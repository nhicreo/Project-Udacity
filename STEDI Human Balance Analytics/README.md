# Project: STEDI Human Balance Analytics
# Project Introduction

In this project, you'll act as a data engineer for the STEDI team to build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.
# Project Details
The STEDI Team has been hard at work developing a hardware STEDI Step Trainer that:

+ trains the user to do a STEDI balance exercise;
+ and has sensors on the device that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect steps;
+ has a companion mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the device sensors.
STEDI has heard from millions of early adopters who are willing to purchase the STEDI Step Trainers and use them.

+ Create S3
+ Creating the Glue Service Role
